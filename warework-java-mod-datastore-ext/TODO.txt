- Include new method "addVariables" which accepts Map to add multiple variables at the same time. DO NOT SPECIFY TYPES IN MAP => Map<String, Object> and check the type at runtime because DataStores will invoke this method and DataStores revieve Hashtable without type.
- Create a KeyValue View for OO Data Stores. 
- Include new parameter in 'ObjectQueryProvider' to retrieve the query serialized.
- Create an annotation that loads and executes a query in a DDBB and sets the result in an attribute of an object.
- Add types in ObjectDatastoreView methods: http://java.dzone.com/articles/generic-crud-facade-your
