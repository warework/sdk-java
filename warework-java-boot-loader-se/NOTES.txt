- GPL compatibility with Apache 2.0 license

	The GPL compatibility is 1-way with Apache 2.0 license - meaning it's fine to use Apache licensed work in 
	a GPL work, but the reverse is not true - you cannot simply use GPL (or LGPL) in Apache 2.0 license works. 
	The LGPL cannot be relicensed under anything other than GPL/AGPL, but it can be used in projects released 
	under another license by linking to it.
	
	The modifications you've made to the LGPL project must be released under the LGPL too (or GPL/AGPL) - your 
	project may link to that modified version and the combined work may still be released under the Apache 2.0 
	license.
	
	You can incorporate your Apache 2.0 work in a closed-source project, but you cannot direcly copy LGPL into 
	it. Linking to LGPL from closed source projects is OK.
	
	In java, you can treat each .class file as an individual library which is linked - so the requirement is that 
	the LGPL licensed .class must also be released in source form - with prominent notice that the LGPL is used, 
	a copy of the LGPL and GPL licenses must be included and displayed along with any other license, and you must 
	provide the information required to link a modified version of it to your apache 2.0 work (in the form of 
	scripts which automate the linking, or documentation)
